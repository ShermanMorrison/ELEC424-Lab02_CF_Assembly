Lab02: Crazyflie Assembly
<PUT NAMES HERE>

Part 1: 8

Q1. What are the two chips on the Bus Blaster? Which companies manufacture them? 
    What are their general purposes? What are they specifically used for on the Bus Blaster?

The two chips are the FT2232H from FTDI, and the XC2C32A from XILINX. 

The FT2232H is for USB to serial communication, which enables USB to JTAG on the Bus Blaster.

The XC232A is the buffer for the FT2232H.

Part 2: 5

Q2. Take a 5 second (-ish) video of the green LED blinking. No need to (somehow) embed the video
    here.

Part 4: 7

Q5. What is the Makefile target that must be called?

Q6. What is a bootloader? What is the main purpose of the Crazyflie bootloader? I.e. what is
    the main functionality provided by the bootloader? 

Q7. How does the CLOAD value affect the compiled firmware?

Part 5: 15

Q3. What is this second method to load a program to the STM chip? Give a brief overview 
    (4/5 sentences) of how you would use the method. Notice we are referring to the chip, 
    so the method should not have anything to do with the Crazyflie code base.

Q4. Without altering the Crazyflie PCB, is it possible to use this method to flash code onto 
    the Crazyflie? How or why not?
